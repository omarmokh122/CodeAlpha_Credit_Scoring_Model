# CodeAlpha_Credit_Scoring_Model
This repository contains a comprehensive pipeline for credit scoring model development and deployment, including data preprocessing, feature scaling, model training, evaluation, and a Gradio-based web interface for real-time predictions.

Features:
-Data Cleaning and Preparation:
  .Functions to clean categorical and numerical data fields.
  .Handling missing values and garbage data.
  .Data scaling using StandardScaler.

-Model Training and Evaluation:
  .Random Forest classifier for credit scoring.
  .Techniques for balancing datasets using SMOTE.
  .Evaluation metrics and model performance assessment.
  
-Deployment:
  .Saving and loading models and scalers using joblib and pickle.
  .Real-time prediction interface built with Gradio.
